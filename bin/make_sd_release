This is an SDcard image for the 6809 multicomp. It contains
images for BASIC, BUGGY, FLEX, FORTH, FUZIX, CUBIX and NITROS9.

Refer to the instructions here:

http://www.retrobrewcomputers.org/doku.php?id=boards:sbc:multicomp:cycloneii-c:start

If you report a problem with this image please include this file
because the checksums below provide some degree of traceability for
the images.

If you want to build any of this from source, or want more documentation or
want to report a bug, the best starting point is my github repository and its
associated WIKI:
