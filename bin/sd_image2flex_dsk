# Given an SDcard image, extract the FLEX system disk image and
# convert it back to .dsk format.


# FLEX system disk
# 3MBytes at offset 68MByte
# 66MByte is block offset 1048576 * 68/512 = 0x2.2000
# there is a multicomp09_flex.dsk which needs to be expanded to
# 512byte sectors.




# original .img size is 2949120 (2.8MBytes)
# simplest to do it in 2 steps.
# (if the image is at the end of the .sd file the second step is redundant and
# the file gets truncated at the correct size.)
dd if=multicomp09_sd.img of=flex_tmp.img ibs=1M obs=1M skip=68 count=3
# TODO this is super-slow (~10s). Better to use a block size of 512 and adjust count
