# Given an SD card image with NITROS disk3 image at offset 86MBytes
# overwrite that disk image with a new dsk image.
#
# Since this is the last of the NITROS disks, you can actually
# insert a much larger image here (eg, 120MByte image) BUT, be
# warned that this will overwrite any other stuff on the SD
# that it overlaps with (typically the FUZIX files).
#
# Usage:
# ./replace_nitros_disk3 FOO.DSK
#
#

SDFILE=multicomp09_sd.img

# 86MByte is block offset 1048576 * 86/512 = 0x2.B000
# The .dsk file needs to be expanded to 512byte sectors.
