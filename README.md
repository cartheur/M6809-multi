# A Motorola 6809 Multi-Computer

![TRS-80-Color](/images/trs-80-color.jpg)

I loved my 6809 machine - A Tandy Color Computer - it took a significant amount of effort to obtain one. I had to save almost a year on a paper route to afford one. Years later, when I started University, I had the CPU in mind when I sketched-out design ideas into a notebook. One day I discovered Camelforth and decided to revamp an [exec09 emulator](https://github.com/cartheur/M6809-exec).

Camelforth runs on real hardware using a hardware bank-switching unit on multicomp Camelforth can also act as boot loader for Grant's port of Microsoft ROM BASIC and for the N8VEM port of Dave Dunfield's CUBIX and for ports of FLEX, NitrOS-9, BUGGY and FUZIX. All of this also runs on `exec09`.

This repository is for sharing the hardware and software that I have used for the M6809 multi-computer.
