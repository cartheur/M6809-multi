# A Motorola 6809 Multi-Computer

![TRS-80-Color](/images/trs-80-color.jpg)

I always loved my 6809 machine - A Tandy Color Computer. When I first went to University, I sketched-out design ideas into an A4 notebook. One day I discovered Camelforth and decided to revamp an [emulator](https://github.com/cartheur/M6809-exec).

Camelforth runs on real hardware using a hardware bank-switching unit on multicomp Camelforth can also act as boot loader for Grant's port of Microsoft ROM BASIC and for the N8VEM port of Dave Dunfield's CUBIX and for my ports of FLEX, NitrOS-9, BUGGY and FUZIX. All of this also runs on exec09.

This repository is for sharing the hardware and software that I have used for the M6809 multi-computer.
